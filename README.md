# Periscope

A sea-level view of your angular scope tree--with inline primitive editing.

Properties are sorted and colored by type class:

* objects and arrays (collections)
* undefined, null, string, number, boolean (primitives)
* functions and methods

#### _Caveat emptor_

This is alpha software--rough seas ahead.
